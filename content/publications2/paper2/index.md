##### Abstract

Global pandemics, such as COVID-19, significantly impact mental and physical well-being. Regular home workouts become more critical during these extraordinary times, as physical activity can positively impact our health. Having the ability to track workout progress motivates consistent home workout schedules. In this paper, we demonstrate two proof-of-concept implementations enabling the tracking of home workouts. First, we demonstrate exercise tracking when the user wears a smartphone relying on IMU data. Second, we show tracking when a doffed phone is placed in front of the user while relying on inaudible Doppler sensing.
