# Welcome to my blog

On this blog, I mainly want to talk about the exciting journey of my PhD. I would therefore be delighted if you would accompany me through the highs and lows, the challenges and successes. I would like to share insights, experiences and the various phases of my doctoral project and maybe I can also share one or two supportive tips. This blog will mainly be written in English to improve my skills and try to write my thoughts and emotions down in this language.

I am very happy to receive your thoughts, but also your questions.
